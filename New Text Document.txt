Since it’s for researchers, so lets think about a Research Assistant App tailored to their real needs.

1. Target Users (Researchers)

Academic researchers (PhD, postdocs, faculty)

Industry R&D researchers

Graduate & advanced undergraduate students

Think-tank / policy researchers

Their biggest pain points:

Reading too many papers

Finding relevant, credible sources

Keeping track of notes, citations, and ideas

Turning research into structured writing

2. Core Features (High-Value for Researchers)
A. Literature Discovery

Semantic search (not just keyword-based)

Filters: year, journal, methodology, citation count

Paper recommendations based on:

Uploaded papers

Research question

Reading history

Nice-to-have: Alert system for new papers in a topic.

B. Paper Understanding & Analysis

Upload PDFs (or import from DOI / arXiv / PubMed)

AI-generated:

Abstract-level summary

Section-by-section summary

Key contributions

Methodology explanation

Limitations & assumptions

“Explain like I’m new to this field” mode

C. Cross-Paper Synthesis (Very Important)

Compare multiple papers:

Agreements & disagreements

Methodological differences

Gaps in the literature

Automatically generate:

Related work summaries

Literature review drafts (with citations)

Topic clustering across papers

D. Research Question Support

Refine vague research ideas into:

Clear research questions

Hypotheses

Variables & metrics

Suggest:

Experimental designs

Data sources

Evaluation methods

E. Notes, Citations & Knowledge Management

Highlight & annotate PDFs

Link notes across papers

Auto-generate citations (BibTeX, APA, MLA)

Citation-aware writing (never hallucinate references)

F. Writing & Drafting Assistance

Section-specific help:

Abstract

Introduction

Related Work

Methods

Style control:

Journal-ready

Concise / detailed

Field-specific tone

Grammar & clarity checks (academic style)

3. MVP Recommendation (Start Here)

If you want a strong but realistic MVP, I’d suggest:

MVP =

PDF upload + paper summarization

Semantic search across uploaded papers

Citation-aware Q&A (“Answer only from these papers”)

Notes + BibTeX export

This alone is already very valuable to researchers.

4. Architecture (High-Level)
Frontend

React / Next.js

PDF viewer with annotation

Chat-style research interface

Backend

API (FastAPI / Node)

Document processing pipeline:

PDF → text → chunks

Embeddings (vector DB)

LLM for reasoning & synthesis

Data Layer

Vector DB: FAISS / Pinecone / Weaviate

Metadata DB: Postgres

File storage: S3-compatible
